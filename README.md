## Description

Zdocm is a documentation theme for Hugo from the original zdoc/zzo theme. It is tailored for education and only meant to support english. References to other languages will be phased out. It's not a proper fork I don't want the name to accidentally confuse the original author(s) RE merges.



## Minimum Hugo version

Hugo version 0.65.0 or higher is required.
